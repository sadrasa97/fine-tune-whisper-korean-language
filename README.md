# Fine-tune Whisper Project Development using Jeju Language Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to fine-tune the Whisper model using the Jeju Language Dataset. The Whisper model is a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. By incorporating the Jeju Language Dataset, which contains speech data from the Jeju dialect, we can enhance the Whisper model's performance for Jeju dialect speech recognition.

## Dataset
The Jeju Language Dataset is a collection of recorded speech samples in the Jeju dialect. It includes various speech patterns, vocabulary, and linguistic nuances specific to the Jeju region. This dataset will serve as valuable training material for fine-tuning the Whisper model to better understand and transcribe Jeju dialect speech.

## Fine-tuning Process
To fine-tune the Whisper model using the Jeju Language Dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Prepare the Jeju Language Dataset by cleaning and formatting the audio files and their corresponding transcriptions.
2. **Training Setup**: Set up the training environment with the necessary dependencies and libraries required for fine-tuning the Whisper model.
3. **Model Configuration**: Configure the Whisper model to accept Jeju dialect speech as input and generate accurate transcriptions.
4. **Fine-tuning**: Train the Whisper model using the preprocessed Jeju Language Dataset, optimizing its performance for Jeju dialect speech recognition.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance by testing it on a separate evaluation dataset containing Jeju dialect speech samples.
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Iterate on the fine-tuning process, adjusting hyperparameters and training strategies to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
